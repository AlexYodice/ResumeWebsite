# ResumeWebsite

This is my first or second attempt at creating a purely front-end HTML website. It consists of multiple sections such as a navbar, about section, portfolio section, and a contact section. The website is designed to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes.

# Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (included in the HTML file)
- [W3.CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/) framework for styling
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for icons
- Google Fonts for font styles

# How to Access the Website

You can access the website by opening the `index.html` file in a web browser. Make sure you have an internet connection to load the external CSS and font files.

# Sections

## Navbar

The website includes a responsive navbar that allows users to navigate to different sections of the website. It contains links to the home, about, portfolio, and contact sections.

### Home Section

The home section features a parallax image with a logo and the name of the website. It serves as an introduction to the website.

## About Section

The about section provides information about myself, as the creator of the website. It includes a brief description and highlights my skills and educational background.

## Portfolio Section

The portfolio section showcases important documents and images that might be of interest. It displays a collection of images that can be clicked to view in full size.

## Contact Section

The contact section displays information about my location and contact details. It also includes a contact form for users to send messages.

#### Additional Notes

- The website is designed to be responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
- External CSS files are included for styling, including the W3.CSS framework.
- External font files are linked from Google Fonts to provide custom typography.
- JavaScript code is included in the HTML file for interactivity.

Feel free to explore the code and modify it as per your requirements.
